if (Math.random() > .5) throw new Error("I'm bad.");

The function Math.random() generates a number between 0 and 0.999...
We don't have control over the number generated by the random() function.
Therefore, it's not possible to define an error percentage based on a comparison, i.e.: >.5
I did three runs as a test, over 10 numbers generated:

>.5     the rest
  7          3
  6          4
  6          4

As we can see in any of these cases a 50% is acquired.

I changed the comparison to >.25, this will increase the chance of generating errors but it cannot be assumed an absolute 75% of the cases, since it's random() dependable.

The thrown new error() function, generates an exception and sends a message to the console.
