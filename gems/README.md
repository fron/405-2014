Notes:

This assignment applied almost everything we did on the prior ones.
The videos were a good help to solve this one.
Most of the changes had to be done in app.html.
The file consumeGems.js is quite similar to buyGems.js, so it was not difficult to follow that.
I had a bit of confussion about using the same data (gems) on two different screens, but I fugure it out hoe to use the same data with different names on each screen.
It was nacessary also to modify the files createdb.bat and test.bat in order to test the assignment.
In general, it's a very good practice.
